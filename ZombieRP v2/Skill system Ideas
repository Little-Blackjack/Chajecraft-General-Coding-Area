Short test of what the idea for the skill are or would be:
My Idea where to give Survivors a little chanse in having a small procetion, won't do much but better than nothing.

Skill Name:Vital Mutation
Skill Desctiption or Info:Staying in the wasteland for a long time comes with side effects (+1 HP every 20 seconds)
Skill type: on (spawn,hit,attacked,death,kill,tick)
Skill Job: Jobs in rp that have been in the wasteland the most (Eg, Stalkers)
Skill Effect Good/Bad sides:Good- Regeneration Bad-Very Slow, Does not stop Bleeding,5 Skill Points
Short test of what the idea for the skill are or would be: My Idea would be to give All jobs a little Mutation from wasteland exposure
giving them a slow regeneration so they do not need to worry about medics alot, but it does not heal bleeding and doesnt heal alot so medics are still vital
